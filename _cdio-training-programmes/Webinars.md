<p>This webinar introduces participants to the CDIO Initiative and Framework,
notably its 2 major elements: the CDIO Syllabus and the CDIO Standards.
It provides concise background of CDIO and interpretations of the Framework.
It is suitable for department head, program lead, etc who wanted to know
more about CDIO; what and how it can be used to guide curriculum redesign.
It is also useful for any faculty tasked with using CDIO to redesign one’s
course(s) in the form of a “crash course” of CDIO, before one embarks on
more in-depth exploration of CDIO via other webinars or workshops.</p>

<p>This webinar introduces participants to a set of core principles of learning,
useful in guiding the design of CDIO Integrated Learning Experiences (Standard
7) in particular, and any teaching and learning activities that make use
of various active learning strategies (CDIO Standard 8) in general. Examples
are provided to illustrate how each core principle can be applied, and
emphasis is placed on achieving the synergistic effect by creatively combining
several core principles within the same learning setting.</p>

<p>This webinar introduces participants to a recommended pedagogy in implementing
flipped classroom as a form of active learning (CDIO Standard 8). This
pedagogy creatively combines the guidance afforded by the core principles
of learning (WB02) and the use of digital technologies (ICT tools) to engage
students in learning. The latter serves to provide evidence of students
or otherwise; and provide timely feedback to enhance learning, often in
real time.</p>

<p>This webinar introduces participants specifically to the CDIO approach
of integrating self-directed learning (SDL) into a curriculum. It helps
participants unpack the underpinning skills and attitudes needed to support
SDL and via the use of the CDIO Syllabus. It illustrates the process using
the example of chemical engineering, explaining how relevant CDIO Standards
- from Integrated Curriculum to Integrated Learning Experiences - are used
to support the integration process. This webinar provides the background
understanding that is built upon by a workshop on SDL (WS1).</p>

of integrating ethical reasoning into a curriculum. It explains the importance
of ethics in one’s professional discipline. It provided a brief literature
review on the topic and outlines different approaches that had been reported.
It then move on to demonstrate how the CDIO Framework can be used, using
examples from chemical engineering. The approach can be used in any engineering
discipline.</p>

skills and attitudes to be developed in a program. It explains how the
syllabus is organized, and explains the “building blocks” approach in using
the foundational skills and attitudes to develop higher order skills and
attitudes. It also explains the needs for validation of a program’s skills
and attitudes with key stakeholders.</p>

Standard 12 Program Evaluation to carry out a self-evaluation process of
one’s program based on the CDIO Framework. It also introduces participants
to techniques commonly used in the business world, namely external scanning
and SWOT analysis. It also illustrates the process via 2 case studies from
chemical engineering, one of which is on how the program responded to the
challenge of Industry 4.0.</p>
