| WB02     | Core Principles of Learning for Designing Learning Tasks     | This webinar introduces participants to a set of core principles of learning, useful in guiding the design of CDIO Integrated Learning Experiences (Standard 7) in particular, and any teaching and learning activities that make use of various active learning strategies (CDIO Standard 8) in general. Examples are provided to illustrate how each core principle can be applied, and emphasis is placed on achieving the synergistic effect by creatively combining several core principles within the same learning setting.      |
