| S/N | Webinar Topic | Synopsis |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| WB01     | Introduction to CDIO for Beginners     | This webinar introduces participants to the CDIO Initiative and Framework, notably its 2 major elements: the CDIO Syllabus and the CDIO Standards. It provides concise background of CDIO and interpretations of the Framework. It is suitable for department head, program lead, etc who wanted to know more about CDIO; what and how it can be used to guide curriculum redesign. It is also useful for any faculty tasked with using CDIO to redesign one’s course(s) in the form of a “crash course” of CDIO, before one embarks on more in-depth exploration of CDIO via other webinars or workshops.     |
| WB02     | Core Principles of Learning for Designing Learning Tasks     | This webinar introduces participants to a set of core principles of learning, useful in guiding the design of CDIO Integrated Learning Experiences (Standard 7) in particular, and any teaching and learning activities that make use of various active learning strategies (CDIO Standard 8) in general. Examples are provided to illustrate how each core principle can be applied, and emphasis is placed on achieving the synergistic effect by creatively combining several core principles within the same learning setting.      |
| WB03     | Pedagogy for Evidence-based Flipped Classroom using ICT     | This webinar introduces participants to a recommended pedagogy in implementing flipped classroom as a form of active learning (CDIO Standard 8). This pedagogy creatively combines the guidance afforded by the core principles of learning (WB02) and the use of digital technologies (ICT tools) to engage students in learning. The latter serves to provide evidence of students or otherwise; and provide timely feedback to enhance learning, often in real time.      |
| WB04     | Integrated Curriculum for Progressive Development of Graduate Attributes     | This webinar introduces participants to CDIO Standard 3 Integrated Curriculum, and how it can be used to guide the development of desired graduate attributes to the desired level of proficiency, in a progressive manner throughout the entire duration of study. It is suitable for the entire program development team, tasked with CDIO adoption for a given program.       |
| WB05     | Integration of Self-Directed Learning into Curriculum     | This webinar introduces participants specifically to the CDIO approach of integrating self-directed learning (SDL) into a curriculum. It helps participants unpack the underpinning skills and attitudes needed to support SDL and via the use of the CDIO Syllabus. It illustrates the process using the example of chemical engineering, explaining how relevant CDIO Standards - from Integrated Curriculum to Integrated Learning Experiences - are used to support the integration process. This webinar provides the background understanding that is built upon by a workshop on SDL (WS1).       |
