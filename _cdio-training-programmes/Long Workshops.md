**WORKSHOPS – LONG (ONLINE or HYBRID or ON-SITE)**

These are 2 to 5 days; or longer events that equips participants with the knowledge and skills needed to execute a program-level CDIO implementation. It can be seen as using CDIO Core Standards 9 and 10, to prepare faculty in other aspects of CDIO, namely Core Standards 1 – 8, 11 and 12; as well as the CDIO Syllabus. Participants choose the workshop that best meet their current needs.

Workshops WL1 (2 days) is meant to provide participants with short and concise introduction to the CDIO Framework, in particular the 12 core standards. It is recommended for all who are interested in using CDIO as the basis of curriculum redesign one’s program but wanted to know more about the scope and depth of such efforts in curricular changes. It is particularly useful for Head of Department / Faculty / School, Program Owners, or other equivalent job roles. This workshop can be conducted fully online.

Workshop WL2 (18 days) provides a comprehensive faculty professional development in CDIO, covering in details how the CDIO Syllabus and each CDIO Core Standard are to be used to design or redesign any program. At the end of this workshop, participants can expect to have a working prototype of a program’s curriculum based on the CDIO Framework. The recommended audience are Program Head, Program Chair or other equivalent job roles, i.e. faculty tasked with leading the CDIO implementation in the institution. These workshops are also suitable for teaching and learning specialists who will assist other faculty in the implementation process. This workshop can be conducted in a hybrid method, whereby the face-to-face sessions comprised both on-site sessions at the host institution and workshops in Singapore Polytechnic.

Workshop WL3 (5 days) are meant to provide participants with short and concise knowledge and skills to kick start a program for adopting the CDIO Framework. It is recommended for all who will be involved in the curriculum redesign process to acquire working know-how in using the CDIO Framework. The main emphasis is on carrying out a Self-Evaluation of one’s program. It can be conducted fully online or preferably on-site at the host institution.

A consultancy fee will be charged for these workshops, which for on-site sessions, will also include air and land travel, meals and accommodation. For sessions to be conducted in SP, all expenses associated with travel, meals and accommodation will be borne by your institution.

| S/N | Workshop Topic | Synopsis |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| WL1     | Basic CDIO Familiarization Program (2-day online)     | This program aims to provide participants with a quick start to CDIO. It provide participants with short and concise introduction to the CDIO Framework, notably the 12 core Standards, and henceforth an appreciation of the scope and depth of curriculum design and redesign effort. It also shares Singapore Polytechnic’s approach to the adoption of the Framework, learning points from the adoption process, and how SP further strengthen the process by augmenting the CDIO Framework with other initiatives such as Design Thinking, setting up of Fab Lab.     |
| WL2     | Comprehensive CDIO Implementation Program (18-day, hybrid)     | This is a comprehensive 18-day full suite of professional development program in CDIO, which can be spread over 1 year. All the CDIO standards are inter-related, and the sequence proposed herein is based on SP’s experience in CDIO implementation that worked well for SP. It is henceforth recommended that participants complete the entire suite of workshops, with intervals between the different components to allow time for participants to apply methods learnt in earlier components. These workshops can be conducted in a hybrid format. It is also recommended that the time frame for completing all components A to G be limited to not more than 14 months. These workshops can also be conducted fully on-site at your institution (or other designated venue in the host country) for which the duration to complete the whole suite is less than 1 year, e.g. by combining several components into 3 to 4 training “blocks”, with each block consisting of several components.     |

It provide sufficient interpretation of each CDIO Standard, and how to use the CDIO Syllabus in the curriculum design or redesign process. It aims to equip participants with adequate understanding of the CDIO Framework to carry out a self-evaluation of one’s program for to aid planning for detailed curriculum changes later. The workshop also shares how the CDIO Standards are used to support continual improvement via alignment to Singapore Polytechnic’s Academic Quality Management System.
