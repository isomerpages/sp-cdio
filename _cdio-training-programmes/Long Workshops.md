<p>These are comprehensive program that equips participants with the knowledge
and skills needed to execute a program-level CDIO implementation. It can
be seen as using CDIO Core Standards 9 and 10, to prepare faculty in other
aspects of CDIO, namely Core Standards 1 – 8, 11 and 12; as well as the
CDIO Syllabus. All the CDIO standards are inter-related, and the sequence
proposed herein is based on SP’s experience in CDIO implementation that
worked well for SP. It is henceforth recommended that participants complete
the entire suite of workshops, with intervals between the different components
to allow time for participants to apply methods learnt in earlier components.
Notwithstanding that, it is also recommended that the maximum total duration
for completing all components be limited to 1 year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recommended audience are Program Head, Program Chair or other equivalent
salutations, i.e. faculty tasked with leading the CDIO implementation in
the institution. These workshops are also suitable for teaching and learning
specialists who will assist other faculty in the implementation process.
These workshops can also be conducted in a hybrid format or fully on-site
at your institution (or other designated venue in the host country) for
which the different elements can be combined into longer duration training
that can be completed in less than 1 year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A consultancy fee will be charged for these workshops.</p>
