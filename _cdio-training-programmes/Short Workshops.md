<p><strong>WORKSHOPS</strong>
</p>
<p>These are 1-3 days events meant for participants who had already acquired
basic understanding of the CDIO Framework. It is most useful for faculty
who wanted to introduce a given CDIO Skill or set of CDIO Skills into his/her
course; or for program chair who are engaged in program review or redesign.
In general, topics covered in the Webinar can be elaborated upon with hands-on
application in one’s specific program/course. 2 special topics of writing
CDIO papers and accreditation are also included. Other topics not listed
here can be arranged.</p>
<p>A small fee will be charged for these workshops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This workshop introduces participants to a Model of Thinking from Dennis
Sale, former Senior Education Advisor from SP. Participants will learn
about the various thinking heuristics underpinning the model, and see how
the model can be used to address any higher order competencies that require
the use of thinking, such as self-directed learning or information literacy.
Participants also get to use the model to learn various thinking approaches
in the literature, e.g. strategic thinking, computational thinking, etc;
by discerning the desired outcomes of such thinking process and unpack
it to show the underpinning heuristics</p>

Syllabus to translate key stakeholders’ requirements into desired learning
outcomes. It allows participants to unpack key competencies required for
a given job role or tasks, and identify the underpinning skills and attitudes
using the CDIO Syllabus. It introduces participants to the “skills-to-build-skills”
approach of progressively develop the desired competencies pegged to the
correct proficiency levels.</p>

<p>This workshop introduces participants to the process of horizon scanning,
to identify change drivers that affect education, to guide an institution’s
response. Tools such as STEEP Analysis and SWOT Analysis will be introduced.
Several use cases will be shared. Participants will get the practice of
identifying change drivers affecting one’s own institution in general and
one’s own program in particular; and explore plausible approaches to address
any challenges.</p>

<p>This workshop provides participants with the understanding of designing
an Integrated Curriculum that progressive develop students competencies
to the desired proficiency levels as required by key stakeholders. Concepts
such as graduate attributes and professional identify will be covered.
The key difference between horizontal and vertical integration will be
highlighted; and guidelines will be given in deciding the depth and breadth
of integration of any desired skill or attitude. Tools such as gap analysis
and competency mapping will be introduced. A case study of chemical engineering
spiral curriculum will be shared. Participants will get to conduct gap
analysis and competency mapping for one’s own program.</p>

<p>This workshop takes participants through the process of integrating self-directed
learning (SDL) competency into one’s course. It starts with participants
defining the context of learning, with emphasis on work scenarios that
employees will be required to use SDL to achieve given task objective(s).
The relevant skills needed for SDL will be unpacked and desired learning
outcomes written using the CDIO Syllabus. The learners’ current SDL proficiency
level will be taken into consideration and the desired proficiency level
will also be ascertained.&nbsp; Participants will then design an integrated
learning experience to develop the required SDL competency.</p>

integrated learning experience using a “reverse engineering” approach.
The case study chosen is one that provide good understanding of what an
integrated learning experience is, regardless of participants domain knowledge.
The design principles will be gradually introduced, and participants will
get to work on “extending” the given case, to deepen their understanding
of how the process is carried out, using a generic graduate attribute of
Global Mindset.</p>

Development Goals (UN SDGs). It provides participants with a pedagogical
approach and systematic process to effectively design integrated learning
experiences that delivers a "dual-impact" learning in that students can
appreciate how the domain knowledge in their chosen field of study can
be used for both professional roles and also contribute to sustainable
development.</p>

is useful but not essential, and as such, is useful for faculty who had
not written conference paper before. The specific nuances of writing for
worldwide audience of the CDIO Community will be highlighted, along with
tips on do’s and don’ts. This session concludes with suggestion on how
a faculty can embark on an action research and reflective practice to pave
the way for writing CDIO papers in the future.</p>
