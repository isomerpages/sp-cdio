These are 3 to 5 hours events focusing on specific integration of selected CDIO skills into a curriculum. Some workshops are generic in nature, but examples used may reflect specific engineering disciplines. Others are case studies based on work done in specific engineering discipline but the approach (based on CDIO) is applicable to other fields of study. 

Participants are expected to already acquire basic understanding of the CDIO Framework. It is most useful for faculty who wanted to introduce a given CDIO Skill or set of CDIO Skills into his/her course. Other topics not listed here can be arranged. 

All workshops can also be delivered on-site at the request of the host institution, as part of larger events such as part of a conference that the host institution is organizing. A small fee will be charged on these workshops when offered online. For on-site delivery, the host institution is expected to also cover all expenses related to air and land travel, meals and accommodation for the facilitator(s).
