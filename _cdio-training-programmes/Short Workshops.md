These are 3 to 5 hours events focusing on specific integration of selected CDIO skills into a curriculum. Some workshops are generic in nature, but examples used may reflect specific engineering disciplines. Others are case studies based on work done in specific engineering discipline but the approach (based on CDIO) is applicable to other fields of study. 

Participants are expected to already acquire basic understanding of the CDIO Framework. It is most useful for faculty who wanted to introduce a given CDIO Skill or set of CDIO Skills into his/her course. Other topics not listed here can be arranged. 

All workshops can also be delivered on-site at the request of the host institution, as part of larger events such as part of a conference that the host institution is organizing. A small fee will be charged on these workshops when offered online. For on-site delivery, the host institution is expected to also cover all expenses related to air and land travel, meals and accommodation for the facilitator(s).

| S/N | Workshop Topic | Synopsis |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| WS1     | Writing Papers for International CDIO Conferences     | This workshop is targeted at faculty who wants to submit paper(s) for International CDIO Conference. Prior experience in scientific paper publication is useful but not essential, and as such, is useful for faculty who had not written conference paper before. A quick introduction to CDIO will first be provided. The specific nuances of writing for worldwide audience of the CDIO Community will be highlighted, along with tips on do’s and don’ts. This session concludes with suggestion on how a faculty new to CDIO can embark on an action research and reflective practice to pave the way for writing CDIO papers in the future.     |
| WS2     | Integrating Self-Directed Learning into Curriculum     | This workshop will explain how self-directed learning (SDL) competency can be integrated into any curriculum using the CDIO Framework. It starts with participants defining the context of learning, with emphasis on work scenarios that employees will be required to use SDL to achieve given task objective(s). The relevant skills needed for SDL will be unpacked and desired learning outcomes written using the CDIO Syllabus. The learners’ current SDL proficiency level will be taken into consideration and the desired proficiency level will also be ascertained.  Participants will then design an integrated learning experience to develop the required SDL competency     |
| WS3     | Integrating Sustainable Development into Curriculum     | This workshop will explain how sustainable development can be integrated into any curriculum using the CDIO Framework. This workshop is useful for any lecturer who wants to introduce sustainable development into his/her course, with specific reference to one or more United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). It provides participants with a pedagogical approach and systematic process to effectively design integrated learning experiences that delivers a "dual-impact" learning in that students can appreciate how the domain knowledge in their chosen field of study can be used for both professional roles and also contribute to sustainable development.      |
