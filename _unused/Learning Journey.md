# Learning Journey

![](/images/beta-version.jpg)

The SP-CDIO Learning Journey is an experiential learning program to Singapore Polytechnic for faculty professional development.  It specifically focused on the following 3 core standards from the CDIO Framework:

* Standard 6: Engineering Learning Workspaces
* Standard 9: Enhancement of Faculty Competence
* Standard 10: Enhancement of Faculty Teaching Competence

A **Certificate of Attendance** will be issued to all participants.

It aims to complement other CDIO core standards derived from various other training programs offered by SP. The Learning Journey comprises a mix of activities ranging from sharing sessions, workshops and facility visits.

SP has a wide range of teaching facilities to cater to the needs of a wide variety of programs, from mathematics, sciences and engineering, and design and humanities. 

The key highlight is the customizability: depending on one’s needs, participants can mix and match areas of interest relevant one’s discipline. For example, participants from background in civil engineering are interested in how digital technologies are introduced into the civil engineering curriculum. They will first understand how SP implement digital transformation in education, followed by targeted sharing by SP in areas of civil engineering, especially in using CDIO to drive the integration of digital technologies in the curriculum; topped with visitations to laboratories in civil engineering. Depending on participants’ needs, specific hands-on sessions can be arranged.

The suggested group size is a **maximum of 20 participants**.

**Typical Program**

The agenda below serves to provide an indication of what the 4-day Learning Journey entails. Customization can be made on a case-by-case basis based on the needs of participants. Also, do note that the actual sequences of activities will be subjected to availability of facilities, which are heavily utilized during term-time. SP may rearrange these activities to meet SP’s own internal timeline.

For planning purposes, it may be useful that one take note of SP’s Academic Calendar, which is available at [https://www.sp.edu.sg/sp/student-services/academic-calendar](https://www.sp.edu.sg/sp/student-services/academic-calendar).
