The Peer-to-Peer Support (P2PS) is an initiative from the CDIO Council to support CDIO Collaborators in improving and enhancing the members’ CDIO implementation effort.

It works by matching up 2 mutually-consenting collaborators, so that they can share with one another how each member implement selected aspects of CDIO in the curriculum.

The 2 members shall agree on the scope of sharing and enter into a Gentlemen’s Agreement to respect the intellectual properties of each other, and to use the information so acquired strictly to the sole intended purpose of curriculum improvement using the CDIO Framework.


If you are interested in collaborating with us,  please get in touch by emailing us at SP_CDIO_Centre_for_Teaching@sp.edu.sg
