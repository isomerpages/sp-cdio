The 3 main guiding questions of the CDIO Approach are:

1. Need: What is the professional role and practical context of the profession?
2. Learning Outcomes: What knowledge, skills and attitudes should students (and adult learners) possess as they graduate from our programmes, and at what level of proficiency?
3. Curriculum, Workspace, Teaching, Learning and Assessment: How can we do better at ensuring that students and adult learners learn these skills?
