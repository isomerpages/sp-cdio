<p>SP was the first Polytechnic established in Singapore in 1954. SP piloted
the CDIO Framework in 2004 when the framework was first introduced by the
initial founding institutions (MIT in US with KTH, Chalmers and Linkoping
in Sweden).</p>
<p>SP was thus the first institution in Singapore to become a CDIO Member.
In 2007, all engineering programs in SP adopted the CDIO Framework, and
several other non-engineering programs also used elements of the Framework
to design their curriculum.</p>
<p>Over the years, we used the CDIO Framework to continually improve our
programs so that they continue to remain relevant to key stakeholders with
up-to-date content backed by innovative teaching and learning practices.</p>
<p>The SP-CDIO Centre was formally established in 2022 to spearhead the use
of the CDIO Framework to drive continual improvements in curricular design
for programs offered by SP. We also envision the Centre to be a resource
and touchpoint for CDIO collaborators to work together in order to address
the challenges in education in today’s VUCA world.</p>
<p>Since adopting CDIO in 2004, there have been several milestones in the
development of CDIO as shown in the graphic below.</p>
<p>Singapore Polytechnic will be taking part in the 19th International CDIO
Conference which will be held in Norway. For more details visit <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/cdio" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ntnu.edu/cdio</a>
