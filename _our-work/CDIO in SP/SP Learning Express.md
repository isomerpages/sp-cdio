Learning Express (LeX) is a 12-day programme that uses Design Thinking to uncover insights and identify unmet needs of overseas grassroots communities.

SP students join the students of Overseas Partner Institutions in social innovation projects across ASEAN. The insights gathered help students co-create purposeful and sustainable solutions for communities. Students also get to enjoy out-of-textbook experiences such as learning a new language and undergoing a community homestay.

By the end of the programme, students gain a deeper understanding of ASEAN as well as how Design Thinking principles can be applied to real-world situations. For more information visit [http://learningexpress.asia/](http://learningexpress.asia/)
