The SP Engineering Show is an annual exhibition that showcases the creations and innovations of SP's final year students from the Engineering courses. This is an important milestone in their education as it gives them an opportunity to stage their product and leave a legacy for their juniors.

In this show, you will see a wide mix of projects - real-life industry-related projects, research projects with local universities and research institutes and multidisciplinary model projects, spread across different themes.

These projects demonstrate the ability of SP's engineering students to integrate both knowledge and skills through a Design Thinking process to innovate and develop products and prototypes that solve real-world problems. This is the result of the successful implementation of the CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement &amp; Operate) curriculum in SP's engineering courses.
